Laundry Management System
1. Project Overview

The Laundry Management System is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline laundry services for hostels, apartments, and small laundry businesses. The system replaces manual processes such as paper registers, phone calls, and verbal updates with an organized online platform where users can place laundry orders, track their status, and manage payments efficiently.

The project aims to reduce operational errors, save time for both customers and service providers, and provide transparency in laundry operations.

2. Problem It Solves

Traditional laundry management suffers from several issues:

Manual record keeping leads to errors and data loss

Customers have no visibility into order status

Laundry staff struggle with order tracking and scheduling

No centralized system for managing users, orders, and payments

Poor communication between customers and service providers

This system solves these problems by providing a centralized, digital, and user-friendly solution for managing laundry services end-to-end.
